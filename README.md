TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Usage Management API

Provides standardized mechanism for usage management such as creation,
update, retrieval, import and export of a collection of usages. The API
manages both rated and non-rated usage. For example, it allows a service
provider to 1) retrieve usage generated by a partner service platform in
order to rate it and 2) to provide rated usage to a partner for
consumption follow up purposes.
